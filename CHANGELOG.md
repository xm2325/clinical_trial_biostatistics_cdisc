# Changelog

## 0.2.0 — 2026-08-21

- Use EX to define observed exposure and safety population.
- Add explicit exposure-date source flags and DS-disposition fallback when EX/DM end dates are both missing.
- Separate raw EX duration (`EXDURN_RAW`) from final treatment-window duration (`TRTDURN`) so fallback dates do not hide source-data incompleteness.
- Use DS to derive randomisation, completion and discontinuation.
- Add subject-level exposure summaries and source-date traceability.
- Add related and moderate/severe TEAE flags.
- Add disposition, exposure, severity and any-TEAE risk-difference outputs.
- Expand required QC plan and machine-readable run metrics.
- Expand tests from derivation/QC smoke tests to analysis and sample-size checks.
- Update GitHub Actions to print measurable live-run results and upload outputs.

## 0.1.0

- Initial DM/AE safety workflow with ADSL-style / ADAE-style derivation, TEAE summaries, sample-size utilities and provenance hashing.
